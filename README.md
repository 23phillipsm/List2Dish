# List2Dish
My personal project for SU24.
Basic functionality: 
- Grocery Tracker -> Recepie finder
  - Manually enter groceries, amount etc
  - search the web for recipies
  - Cook & update pantry

Future functionalities: 
- Receipt parser
  - Automatically update pantry from receipt
  - Track length of food/expiration(guesstimate it?? tbd)
  - Generalize specific product names into general groceries (ie Rao's Sauce -> Pasta Sauce)
  - Classify between processed ready to eat vs fresh ingredients
- Shopping List
  - Find recepie's for future meals, integrate to a shopping list
  - Automatically add generic foods (eggs, milk, salt, pepper, bread, rice, etc)
- GenAI recepie's(still deciding)
  - Let some AI model take the groceries in my pantry and make a recepie
